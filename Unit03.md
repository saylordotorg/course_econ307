**Unit 3: Exchange Rates and Open-Economy Macroeconomics** <span
id="3"></span> 
*The previous units were concerned primarily with the problem of making
the best use of the world’s scarce productive resources at a single
point in time.  In this unit, we shift our focus and ask: How can
economic policy ensure that factors of production are fully employed? 
And what determines how an economy’s capacity to produce goods and
services changes over time?  We will learn how the interactions between
national economies influence the worldwide pattern of macroeconomic
activity.  We will also discuss the role of trade in growth and welfare
in an open economy, the causes and consequences of factor mobility, as
well as the role of multinationals.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 36 hours and 30 minutes to
complete.

**3.1 National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments** <span
id="3.1"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will discuss the concept of the current
account balance, use the current account balance to extend national
income accounting to open economies, and apply national income
accounting to the interaction between saving, investment, and net
exports.  We will also describe the balance of payments accounts,
learning the relationship between that balance and the current account
balance.  Then, we will relate the current account to changes in a
country's net foreign wealth.*

**3.3 Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates** <span
id="3.3"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will discuss the national money markets in
which interest rates are determined, learn how monetary policy and
interest rates feed into the foreign exchange market, and distinguish
between the economy's long-run position and its short-run position (in
which money prices and wages are sticky).*  *We will also explain how
price levels and exchange rates respond to monetary factors in the long
run.  Then, we will outline the relationship between the short-run and
long-run effects of monetary policy and explain the concept of short-run
exchange rate overshooting.*

**3.4 Price Levels and the Exchange Rate in the Long Run** <span
id="3.4"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will explain the purchasing power parity
theory of exchange rates and the theory's relationship to international
goods-market integration.  We will also describe how monetary factors
(such as ongoing price level inflation) affect exchange rates in the
long run, discuss the concept of the real exchange rate, and demonstrate
factors that affect real exchange rates and relative currency prices in
the long run.  Then, we will explain the relationship between
international real interest rate differences and expected changes in
real exchange rates.*

**3.5 Output and the Exchange Rate in the Short Run** <span
id="3.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit will explain the role of the real exchange rate in
determining the aggregate demand for a country's output.  We will also
learn how an open economy's short-run equilibrium can be analyzed as the
intersection of an asset market equilibrium schedule (AA) and an output
market equilibrium schedule (DD).  Then, we will explore how monetary
and fiscal policies affect the exchange rate and national output in the
short run, describe and interpret the long-run effects of permanent
macroeconomic changes, and explain the relationship among macroeconomic
policies, the current account balance, and the exchange rate.*

**3.6 Fixed Exchange Rates and Foreign Exchange Rates** <span
id="3.6"></span> 
*Note: This unit will demonstrate how a central bank must manage
monetary policy so as to fix its currency's value in the foreign
exchange market.  We will also analyze the relationship between the
central bank's foreign exchange reserves, its purchases and sales in the
foreign exchange market, and the money supply.  Then, we will explain
how monetary, fiscal, and sterilized intervention policies affect the
economy under a fixed exchange rate, discuss causes and effects of
balance of payments crises, and describe how alternative multilateral
systems for pegging exchange rates work.*
