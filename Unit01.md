**Unit 1: International Trade Theory** <span id="1"></span> 
*Countries engage in international trade for two basic reasons, each of
which contributes to the country’s gain from trade.  First, countries
trade because they are different from one another.  Nations, like
individuals, can benefit from their differences by reaching agreements
in which each party contributes its strengths and focuses on producing
goods in which each is especially efficient.  Second, countries trade to
achieve economies of scale in production.  That is, if each country
produces only a limited range of goods, it can produce each of these
goods at a larger scale and hence more efficiently than if it tried to
produce everything.  In the real world, patterns of international trade
reflect the interaction of both of these motives. *  
  
 *This unit will help you develop the tools you need to understand how
differences between countries give rise to trade between them and why
this trade is mutually beneficial.  After a brief introduction to the
general topic of international trade, we will begin by analyzing how
comparative advantage acts as a trade pattern determinant.  You will
also be introduced to the Ricardian model of trade.  The unit will then
discuss capital as a factor of production, covering the Heckscher-Ohlin
model of trade.  We will investigate which factors gain and lose from
trade in the short-run as well as in the long-run before learning how
economies of scale, technology, demand, and transport costs contribute
to patterns of trade.  The unit will conclude with a discussion of the
reasons behind intra-industry trade, taking note of what new trade
theories have to say about it.*

**1.3 Labor Productivity and Comparative Advantage: The Ricardian
Model** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will learn how the Ricardian model (the most
basic model of international trade) works and how it illustrates the
principle of comparative advantage.  We will also demonstrate gains from
trade and refute common fallacies about international trade.  Finally,
we will take a look at empirical evidence that wages reflect
productivity and that trade patterns reflect relative productivity.*

Time Advisory: This sub-unit will take approximately 8 hours and 15
minutes to complete.  
  
 *Note: In this subunit, we will learn how differences in resources can
lead to international trade, discuss why trade creates both losers and
winners, and define gains from trade when there are losers. We will also
discuss the reasons why trade is a politically contentious issue and
weigh arguments for free trade in light of the fact that owners of
scarce factors are predicted to be worse off without compensation.*

**1.5 The Standard Trade Model** <span id="1.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit will demonstrate how the components of the standard
trade model, production possibilities frontiers, isovalue lines, and
indifference curves fit together in order to illustrate how trade
patterns are established by a combination of supply-side and demand-side
factors.  We will also discuss how changes in the terms of trade,
economic growth, and transfers between nations affect the welfare of
nations engaged in international trade. Then, we will examine the
effects that tariffs and subsidies have on trade patterns and the
welfare of trading nations as well as on the distribution of income
within countries.*

**1.6 Economies of Scale, Imperfect Competition, and International
Trade** <span id="1.6"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will describe why international trade often
occurs due to increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition.  We
will also identify the source of intra-industry trade and determine how
it differs from inter-industry trade.  Then, we will detail the
“dumping” arguments used by domestic industries as a basis for
protectionism and explain the relationship between dumping and price
discrimination.  Lastly, we will discuss the role of external economies
and knowledge spillovers in shaping comparative advantage and
international trade patterns.*
