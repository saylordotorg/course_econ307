Course Syllabus for "ECON307: International Trade"
--------------------------------------------------

This course will provide you with an analytical framework for the study
of international trade.  Historically, international trade has played a
critical role in enabling countries to grow, develop, and become
economically powerful.  Through international trade in goods and
services, the economies of different countries are more closely linked
to one another now than ever before.  At the same time, the world
economy is more turbulent now than it has been in decades.  Keeping up
with the shifting international environment has become a central concern
in business strategy and national economic policy.  This course uses the
same fundamental methods of analysis deployed in other branches of
economics, as the motives and behavior of individuals and firms remain
the same whether they are in the context of international trade or
domestic transactions.  You will learn, however, that international
trade introduces an entirely new and different set of concerns as well.
This course will cover a broad array of relevant topics.  We will
explore both theoretical models and empirical studies as we seek to
determine a model that best fits “real world” data.  This course will
frequently compare and contrast competing theories concerning the nature
of international trade and the gains or losses thereof.  We will work to
understand the economic intuition behind technically demanding models
and define the assumptions behind various theories before evaluating how
well those models fit actual trading economies.  We will also explore
the relevance and policy implications of various theories/models,
especially in terms of growth, income distribution, and development.

### Learning Outcomes

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON307.  Below, please find general information on the
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designers: **Joy Zhao and Michael McPherson  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Krugman and Obstfeld’s *[International Economics: Theory and
    Policy:](http://wps.aw.com/aw_krgmnobstf_interecon_8/84/21573/5522920.cw/index.html)*
    PowerPoint Lectures for Chapters 1-14
-   *[International Economics: Theory and
    Policy](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/International%20Economics%20-%20Theory%20and%20Policy.pdf)*

**Course Requirements: **To successfully complete this course, you will
need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.  Pay
special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more exploratory material in latter units.  You will
also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Assessments
-   Unit 2 Assessments
-   Unit 3 Assessments
-   Unit 4 Assessments
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the course materials and the assessments listed above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **142
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take you 42.25 hours to complete.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 4.75 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 5.25
hours) on Tuesday night; and so forth.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Take comprehensive notes as you study each
resource in this course.  These notes will serve as a useful review as
you study for your Final Exam.
