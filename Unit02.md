**Unit 2: International Trade Policy** <span id="2"></span> 
*The previous unit answered the question, “Why do nations trade?” by
describing the causes and effects of international trade and the
functioning of a trade world economy.  While this question is
interesting in and of itself, its answer is much more interesting if it
helps us answer the question: “What should a nation’s trade policy
be?” *  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin our investigation of trade policy issues
by analyzing the implications of tariffs for trade and welfare.  We will
then move on to non-tariff barriers and their implications before
concluding with a discussion of the arguments for restricting trade and
an overview of the political economy of trade policy.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 26 hours and 45 minutes to
complete.

**2.1 The Instruments of Trade Policy** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will evaluate the costs and benefits of
tariffs, their welfare effects, and winners and losers from tariff
policies. We will also discuss what export subsidies and agricultural
subsidies are, and explain how they affect trade in agriculture in the
United States and the European Union. Then, we will explain the effect
of voluntary export restraints on both importing and exporting
countries, and describe how the welfare effects of voluntary export
restraints compare with tariff and quota policies.*

**2.3 Trade Policy in Developing Countries** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will recapitulate the case for protectionism
as it has been historically practiced in developing countries and
discuss import-substitution-led industrialization and the "infant
industry" argument.  Then, we will summarize the basic ideas behind
"economic dualism" and its relationship to international trade. We will
also explore the recent economic history of various East Asian
countries, including Taiwan and South Korea, and detail the relationship
between their rapid economic growth and their participation in
international trade.*

**2.4 Controversies in Trade Policy** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will summarize the more sophisticated
arguments for interventionist trade policy, especially those related to
externalities and economies of scale.  We will also evaluate the claims
of the anti-globalization movement concerning trade effects on workers,
labor standards, and the environment.  We will conclude by discussing
the role of the WTO as a forum for resolving trade disputes and
addressing the tension between the rulings of the WTO and individual
national interests.*
