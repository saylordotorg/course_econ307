**Unit 4: International Macroeconomic Policy** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the previous unit, we saw how a country can use monetary, fiscal,
and exchange rate policy to change the levels of employment and
production within its borders. The inherent independence of open
national economies has sometimes made it more difficult for governments
to achieve such policy goals as low unemployment and stable prices. The
channels of independence depend, in turn, on the monetary and exchange
rate arrangements that are adopted by countries and are collectively
known as the international monetary system. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how the international monetary system
influences macroeconomic policy-making and performance.  We will also
apply models of fixed and floating exchange rates to examine the recent
performance of floating rates and to compare the macroeconomic policy
problems of different exchange rate regimes.  Then, we will study the
role that international trade plays in both developing countries and
economies transitioning from a central planning system to a market-based
one.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**

**4.1 The International Monetary System, 1870-1973** <span
id="4.1"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will learn how the goals of internal and
external balance motivate economic policy makers in open economies.  We
will also discuss the structure of the international gold standard that
linked countries' exchange rates and policies prior to World War I, and
the role of the Great Depression of the 1930s in ending efforts to
restore the pre-1914 world monetary order.  Then, we will discuss how
the post-World War II Bretton Woods system of globally fixed exchange
rates was designed to combine exchange rate stability with limited
autonomy of national macroeconomic policies, list and assess the policy
options available for attaining internal and external balance under the
Bretton Woods arrangements, and explain the factors that led to the
final collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 (and the subsequent
shift to the current system of floating exchange rates).*

**4.2 Macroeconomic Policy and Coordination under Floating Exchange
Rates** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will examine the reasons why many economists
favor an international financial system based on floating dollar
exchange rates and the counterarguments they face.  We will also discuss
how commodity-price and policy disturbances raised inflation and
unemployment in the early years of floating exchange rates (1973-1980),
summarize how the monetary and fiscal policies of a large country such
as the United States are transmitted abroad, and describe the effects of
the disinflationary and fiscal policies followed by the United States in
the 1980s and the role of international policy coordination.  Then, we
will discuss how the world economy has performed in recent years and
consider the lessons the post-1973 experience holds in terms of
reforming the international monetary system.*

**4.3 Optimum Currency Areas and the European Experience** <span
id="4.3"></span> 
*Note: In this subunit, we will discuss why Europeans have long sought
to stabilize their mutual exchange rates while floating against the U.S.
dollar.  We will also learn how the European Union, through the
Maastricht Treaty of 1991, placed itself on the road to having a single
currency (the euro) issued and managed by a European System of Central
Banks (ESCB).  We will then detail the structure of the ESCB and the
European Union's restrictions on member states' fiscal policies,
articulate the main lessons of the theory of optimum currency areas, and
recount how the 17\* countries using the euro have fared so far in their
currency union.  
  
 \*This number reflects the number of Eurozone countries as of Oct. 17,
2011.*
